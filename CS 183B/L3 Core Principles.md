# Startup Fundamentals: Lesson 3
## Core Principles and Student Considerations

### The Counter-Intuitive Nature of Startups

1. Trust and Instinct
   - Don't rely solely on instincts
   - Startup success often contradicts conventional wisdom
   - Focus on users rather than startup mechanics

2. The All-Consuming Reality
   - Startups require complete dedication
   - Problems evolve but never decrease
   - The total amount of worry remains constant
   - Quality of challenges may improve, but quantity doesn't diminish

### Special Considerations for Students

1. The Student-Founder Dilemma
   - It's nearly impossible to be both a full-time student and founder
   - Age 20 is ideal for exploration and deep diving into projects
   - Travel and learn without immediate startup pressure
   - Don't start a startup while still a student (due to commitment requirements)

2. Ideation Approach
   - Avoid forcing startup ideas
   - Let ideas emerge naturally from experience
   - Use student time to:
     - Explore different fields
     - Meet potential cofounders
     - Develop technical skills
     - Gain diverse experiences

### Key Takeaways
- Success in startups often requires counterintuitive thinking
- The startup journey never gets easier, only different
- Student years are better spent in exploration than immediate startup founding
- Natural ideation beats forced brainstorming
- Focus on building expertise and relationships during student years
